1. STOCKFISH
=========================
Authors: T. Romstad, M. Costalba, J. Kiiski, G. Linscott
Version: 7
Date: January 2016
Elo (CCRL 40/4): 3360
Levels: yes
Chess960: yes
License: GPLv3
Source: https://stockfishchess.org/
Description: Stockfish is universally recognized as the strongest open source engine
in the world. Even on the modest hardware of a Raspberry Pi 3 it easily beats every
super grandmaster. The vast amount of chess knowledge programmed into Stockfish makes
it an ideal engine to analyze your games. You can set the engine at a lower skill
level to have a chance of winning. Stockfish also supports Chess960 ('Fischer Random
Chess').


2. TEXEL
=========================
Author: Peter Österlund
Version: 1.06
Date: July 2016
Elo: 3050
Levels: yes
Chess960: no
License: GPLv3
Source: http://web.comhem.se/petero2home/javachess/index.html#texel
Description: Texel is the successor to CuckooChess. It is a very strong engine that
will beat every human GM. But thanks to its different skill levels, Texel will
appeal to chess players of every strength. For absolute beginners there is even
a level 0, which lets the engine play random legal moves.


3. ARASAN
=========================
Author: Jon Dart
Version: 20.2
Date: July 2017
Elo: 2950
Levels: yes
Chess960: no
License: MIT
Source: http://arasanchess.org/
Description: Arasan, or 'king' in the Tamil language, is a chess engine that has been
around since 1994 – much longer than most other engines. It has evolved a lot over
the years and is now a very attractive GM level engine. Arasan has a lot of features,
including skill levels to make it an attractive opponent for players of every strength.


4. RODENT III
=========================
Author: Paweł Kozioł
Version: 0.210
Date: August 2017
Elo: 2920
Levels: 'Personalities'
Chess960: no
License: GPLv3
Source: https://github.com/nescitus/Rodent_III/
Description: RodentIII is one of the few chess engines in the world that can adopt
'personalities': it offers different playing styles rather than strength levels.
RodentIII can just as easily be turned into a strong GM as into a beginning kid.
It has both serious and funny personalities, like the positional defender and the
crazy attacker.


5. ZURICHESS
=========================
Author: Alexandru Moșoi
Version: luzern
Date: July 2017
Elo: 2790
Levels: yes ('Handicaps')
Chess960: no
License: BSD
Source: http://www.zurichess.xyz/
Description: Zurichess is a relatively young engine. Unlike most other engines
it is not written in C++ but in the Go computer language. And unlike other
engines, its versions are not numbered but named after the cantons of
Switzerland. New versions of Zurichess are rapidly following up each other.
The current version plays at GM level. Weaker opponents may like to set its
handicap level a little higher.


6. FLOYD
=========================
Author: Marcel van Kervinck
Version: 0.9
Date: July 2016
Elo: 2660
Levels: no
Chess960: no
License: BSD
Source: https://github.com/kervinck/floyd/
Description: Originally written as a study in chess engine writing, Floyd has
quickly become one of the best master (FM/IM) strength engines. It was not
written for speed or strength, but rather for 'clarity and ease of change'.
Nevertheless, the engine has an attractive style of play. Unfortunately
for weaker human players, Floyd cannot be forced to play weaker.


7. CINNAMON   
=========================
Author: Giuseppe Cannella
Version: 2.0
Date: May 2016
Elo: 2060
Levels: no
Chess960: no
License: GPLv3
Source: https://github.com/gekomad/Cinnamon/
Description: Cinnamon is the successor to Butterfly. It is an attractive opponent
for experienced club players. This engine does not play too strong but is not
very easy to beat either. If you have no FM or IM title and are looking for
a beatable engine that can teach you a thing or two about chess, then Cinnamon is
a good choice.


8. GALJOEN
=========================
Author: Werner Taelemans
Version: 0.36
Date: July 2017
Elo: 2150
Levels: yes
Chess960: yes
License: GPLv3
Source: http://www.goudengaljoen.be/
Description: Galjoen is a chess engine that plays at (stronger) club level. It has
an active playing style. Together with its support for strength levels and Chess960
('Fischer Random Chess') this makes Galjoen an ideal opponent for club players
to practice their tactical and strategical skills. The program has its own graphical
user interface, which is, of course, not used by PicoChess.
